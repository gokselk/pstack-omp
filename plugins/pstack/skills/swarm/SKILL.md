# Swarm

In omp, map the Cursor names in this skill with these rows. `skill://pstack-omp-adapter` has the full map. If a Cursor field has no row in either, drop it and say so. Never pass a field or value the tool schema rejects. Write the omp name, never the Cursor one, in replies, briefs, and questions to the user.

When the `task` description lists approved per-call models, set `model` on every item whose role line names a model. Use the role's value unchanged. The list appears only when `task.perCallModel` is on. A `model` field in the schema alone is not enough, because the bundled seance agent adds it too. Without the list, leave `model` off, say so once per session, and tell the user that `/skill:setup-pstack` turns per-role models on.

omp has no Cursor Automations, Bugbot, Cursor cloud agents, or built-in PR tool. When a step needs one, put one line in your reply, `Skipped in omp: <step>. <reason>.`, then go on to the next step. Do not stop, ask, or retry. When a later step needs what the skipped step made, such as a URL or a key, leave a placeholder and name it in the line.

| Cursor | omp |
| --- | --- |
| `Task` | `task`. With the batch schema, send `{ context, tasks: [{ agent, model, name, task, solutionSpace }] }`: `context` is shared background and each `task` is self-contained. Write `agent` and `model` as the first keys of each item, before `task`, whenever the skill names a subagent type or a model. Written after a long `task`, they get left out. |
| Open a todolist | `todo` with `op: "init"`, one phase per playbook stage. Send it beside your next real tool call. Subagents have no `todo`, so they keep the list in their reply. |
| Run another pstack skill (`/name` or "the **name** skill") | `read skill://<name>` and follow it. When you tell the user to type it, write `/skill:<name>`. |
| `subagent_type: generalPurpose` | Omit `agent`. The default `task` agent runs. |
| `environment: "cloud"` | `isolated: true` when the `task` schema offers `isolated` (needs `task.isolation.enabled`). Name the branch or commit the worker checks out. Without it, make a checkout with `git worktree add`, or `ovnfs new` when the system prompt offers it, and give the worker its path. |
| `cloud_base_branch: <b>` | Tell the worker to check out `<b>` first. |
| `run_in_background: true` | Omit. With async on, spawns already run in the background and their results arrive on their own. Call `wait` only when you are blocked with nothing else to do. |
| A pstack file in a `Task` brief, such as a reference prompt or a playbook | Name it as `skill://<name>/<path>`, such as `skill://reflect/references/synthesizer.md`. Subagents resolve it as you do; a relative or `plugins/pstack/...` path sends them searching the disk. When the brief has them follow a pstack skill or reference prompt, also tell them to read `skill://pstack-omp-adapter` first. |
| A `grok-*`, `gpt-*`, or other slug | The same shape, with the selector `omp models` lists for that family, such as `xai/grok-4.7:xhigh`. If none is listed, omit `model` and say so. |
| `auto` or `inherit-parent` | Omit `model`. |
| The `pstack-models.mdc` rule, `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc` | `~/.omp/agent/rules/pstack-models.md`. It is an always-applied rule, so its role lines are already in your system prompt. If they are not, read the file. Pass a role's value `<provider>/<model-id>:<effort>` as `model` on each item, unchanged. If the file or the role's line is missing, use the skill's default slug. omp also loads `~/.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, so map any Cursor slug you find there with the rows above. |
| The `Task` tool rejects the slug | Preflight fails with `Per-call model … is not approved` or `not available`. Handle it as the skill's rejected-slug case. If preflight says `task.perCallModel` does not allow the call, omit `model` for the rest of the session and say so once. |
| `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, always-applied rules | `AGENTS.md`, or a `.omp/rules/<name>.md` rule with `alwaysApply: true`. User-wide rules go in `~/.omp/agent/rules/`. The model rule is the exception. See Models. |
| Cursor cloud agents | `environment: "cloud"` maps to an isolated checkout, as in Subagent fields. Skip a step that needs the cloud agent itself, such as its dashboard status or its own machine. |

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc`. If the rule or that line is missing, use `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast`. For `auto` or `inherit-parent`, omit `model` so the workers run on the parent model. If the Task tool rejects a slug, use the default and say so. If it rejects the default, use the closest valid slug of the same family from its error message. For a model race, name each arm's model up front. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.
4. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message with `subagent_type: generalPurpose`, `environment: "cloud"`, `run_in_background: true`, and the step 3 model, left unset for `auto` or `inherit-parent`. Use `environment: "local"` only when the worker needs access to something on the user's computer.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, pass `cloud_base_branch`.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with a result table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
